ðŸ›  Building Blocks of Code: My C Programming Journey

Starting with C programming laid the groundwork for every language that follows. With each conceptâ€”whether recursion, pointers, or memory managementâ€”Iâ€™m not just learning C; Iâ€™m constructing a toolkit for the future. Join me as I build, break, and refine my understanding of programming from the ground up.


This repository documents my journey of learning C programming from basics to advanced concepts.

Basics: Control structures, loops, and functions
Arrays & Strings: Operations on 1D/2D arrays and strings
Recursion & Sorting: Recursive problem-solving and sorting algorithms
Advanced Topics: File handling, pointers, and dynamic memory allocation
Mini Projects: Calculator, day-of-week finder


How C Programming Has Helped ?

Learning C programming has built a solid foundation that makes learning other languages, like Java, much easier. Now, when tackling problems in Java, I find that I only need to adjust the syntax while the core concepts stay the same. This head start in problem-solving is thanks to the thorough practice Iâ€™ve had in C, as shown in the various topics and individual questions covered in this journey.
